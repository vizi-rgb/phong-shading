# Phong Shading Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of Phong shading, a technique used to achieve realistic 3D shading by applying the Phong reflection model. The scene includes a single light source illuminating two spheres made of various materials. The materials used in this project include:

- Metallic
- Pearl
- Bronze
- Polished Bronze
- Gold
- Chrome
- Wooden

Additionally, the project showcases two spheres with different lighting properties:
- One sphere with minimum diffuse lighting and maximum specular lighting.
- Another sphere with minimum specular lighting and maximum diffuse lighting.

## Controls

- **Move Light Source**:
  - Arrow Up: Move light source forwards.
  - Arrow Down: Move light source backwards.
  - Arrow Left: Move light source left.
  - Arrow Right: Move light source right.
  - Left Shift: Move light source up.
  - Left Control: Move light source down.

- **Cycle Through Materials**:
  - B: Select previous material.
  - N: Select next material.
